# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Dank Memer has tons of features, and it is easy to be overwhelmed or confused if you are new to the game. We've written some answers to common questions users have below to try to help get you started, but it would be impossible to answer everything. The best way to learn more about the bot is by using it and interacting with other users.


## How do I set up Dank Memer in my server?
If you need help setting up Dank Memer in your server, there are two guides that help explain Discord's integrations and how to restrict Dank Memer to specific channels, roles, or users.
- <a href="https://dankmemer.lol/tutorial/set-up-dank-memer" target="_blank">Dank Memer Setup Tutorial</a>
- <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4644915651095-Command-Permissions" target="_blank">Discord's Guide to Command Permissions</a> 

If the above guides don't answer all of your setup questions, you can also join the <a href="https://discord.gg/dankmemerbot" target="_blank">Dank Memer Official Support Server</a> for help.

## How do I level up?
Each level requires a certain number of experience (XP) points for you to <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Advancements#LevelRewards" target="_blank">level up</a> to the next one. The higher the level you go, the more XP that is required to level up. Every <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands" target="_blank">currency command</a> you run has a chance to give you XP so you can level up. 

You can level up faster by activating boost items like <a href="/Items/Power-ups#ShreddedCheese" target="_blank">Shredded Cheese</a>, <a href="/Items/Lootboxes#DailyBox" target="_blank">Daily Boxes</a>, and <a href="/Items/Collectables#CowboyBoots" target="_blank">Cowboy Boots</a> to increase your <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Multipliers#XPMulti" target="_blank">XP multiplier</a>. There are also 5 random double XP days each month that are announced in the <a href="https://discord.gg/memers" target="_blank">Dank Memer Community</a> server.

## How do I use the market?
The <a href="https://dankmemer.lol/community/blog/new-way-to-trade" target="_blank">market</a> can be used to buy and sell items for coins or other items. The ads are posted anonymously, but you can also negotiate private deals with people and get a private market ID you can share directly with them. Read more about the <a href="https://dankmemer.lol/community/blog/new-way-to-trade" target="_blank">basic market commands here</a>, or check out the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Market" target="_blank">full tutorial here</a>.

When buying or selling on the market, the most important thing to notice is that there are three prices for every item. First, there is the price on the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Basic-Commands#Item" target="_blank">/item</a> page. This is the average value of the item, and that is what is used to calculate your net worth. There are also the selling and buying prices for ads on the market. 

The average value of an item listed on the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Basic-Commands#Item" target="_blank">/item</a> page gives you an idea of what your items are worth, but when pricing your ads for the market, it is better to pay attention to the buy and sell prices on existing market ads in `/market view` instead. Existing ads show what people are willing to buy or sell an item for and are a useful way to price your own items and figure out what they are worth. If there are no ads, you can often try to increase or decrease the price of an item by making your own price.

## What is the best item to collect?
The question most users want to know is what to collect or invest in. This is an impossible question to really answer because once people begin telling others to collect in something, many invest in it, and the value can decrease as more and more enter the bot's economy. There is also never a guarantee that something will go up in value, so investment advice should always be considered carefully.

In general, when deciding what to collect, there are a few things to consider:
- How useful is this item to the community?
- How easy is this item to obtain, or how rare is it?
- How much do people want this item?

These three questions can help you evaluate an item to figure out if it is a good idea to invest in it or not. For example, shop items are incredibly useful to the community, but because they are available to buy from the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Basic-Commands#Shop" target="_blank">/shop</a> most of the time, they are often not a good long-term investment if you are hoping they become worth a ton. On the other side of things, <a href="/Items/Drops" target="_blank">drop items</a> are often exclusive to limited drop events, so they can be a great investment choice if you want something that is more exclusive and rare. 

Ultimately, though, the biggest factor in what goes up in value or not is whether other users want to collect it! Drop items had a period of time where <a href="https://dankmemer.lol/community/blog/drop-item-lookback" target="_blank">they skyrocketed in price</a> because a handful of users tried to collect them all, but once those users stopped, they quickly decreased in value.  

## What is the best way to grind?
Every user has a different method of grinding that works best for them, but there are a few key things that all users should do.
- Use a <a href="/Bot-features/Utility-and-Config-Commands/Config-Commands#Flow" target="_blank">flow</a> for faster command usage.
- Try to increase your <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Multipliers#XPMulti" target="_blank">XP Multiplier</a> as much as you can.
- Grind in a <a href="/About-Dank-Memer/About-the-bot#Partners" target="_blank">partner server</a> for an XP boost and <a href="/About-Dank-Memer/Premium-users#Perks" target="_blank">premium cooldowns</a>.
- Keep an eye out for captchas!

The best place to get more specific advice about grinding is from other users. The <a href="https://discord.gg/memers" target="_blank">Dank Memer Community</a> server has a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/682809584985178135/1091017663054098573" target="_blank">grind strategy channel</a> where users can discuss their techniques and  help each other, as well as a flow-sharing channel where users can share their favorite flows. Check them out for more info! 

In order to see the grind strategy in DMC, make sure to grab the "Grinder" role via the `#channels & roles` option at the top left of the server channel list.

## Other questions?
If you have questions that are not answered above, there are three main suggestions for you to find answers.

- **For basic questions,** like how to use the bot or certain commands, join a server that is focused on Dank Memer and ask other users. 
-- The <a href="https://discord.gg/memers" target="_blank">Dank Memer Community server (DMC)</a> is the official Dank Memer server, so it is easy to find answers there from other users. 
-- You can also use the <a href="/About-Dank-Memer/About-the-bot#Partners" target="_blank">/partners</a> command to find servers that are partnered with Dank Memer to see if you can make friends who can help.
-- Or join the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemer/" target="_blank">Dank Memer Reddit</a> and make a post with your question to see if other users can help.

- **For more advanced questions** that the average user might not know, or if you are encountering a bug, the best thing to do is to go to the <a href="https://discord.gg/dankmemerbot" target="_blank">Dank Memer Official Support Server</a>. There is a support staff there ready to help users with bot issues that regular players can't answer.


If there is something you think should be a part of the wiki, email us to let us know! We won't be able to email back and give personal help with the bot, but we would love to hear suggestions about anything you feel is missing.
