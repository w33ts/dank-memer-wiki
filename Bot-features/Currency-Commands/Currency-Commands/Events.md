# Pink Event
In 2023, the developers of Dank Memer decided to remove the Pink Plastic Bit item from the bot. To make it something fun instead of something sad, they decided to make it a special event with rewards and a competition.

## Pink Event Details

The Pink Event was called the "Bit of a Change" event and it began on Auugust 14, 2023 and ended on September 19, 2023. The event centered around an item called Pink Plastic Bits. Originally, this item was known as a Pink Phallic Object and was obtainable in the Dank Memer shop for a very cheap price. You could use the item and it would send whoever you used it on a DM teasing them about receiving a "naughty" surprise.

When Dank Memer decided to remove NSFW content from the bot, the Pink Phallic Object was renamed to Pink Plastic Bits and it became an item used for crafting. In early 2023, the developers decided this item was taking up too much data in the bot because there were more than 80 billion of them in the system. To help improve the bot and to remove a relatively useless item, they decided to remove Pink Plastic Bits from the bot and turned it into the "Bit of a Change" Event.

During the event, users could donate their pinks to the bot for 1 coin and compete to be the top donor. There were rewards that would be unlocked for the individual user as well as globally if certain milestones were reached.

By the end of the event, more than 24 billion pink plastic bits had been donated and users had unlocked:
- The Pink Farm Skin
- The Axolotl Pet
- A new Dig Boss (Pink Sludge Monster)
- The Pink Blob Pet Skin
- A Pink Fish Tank Skin
- A Pink Fishing Bucket
- The Margaux Handler Fishing NPC


Users could compete on an individual level to be the top donor as well, and the top 3 donors of the event recieved an exclusive pink bit badge, titles, and the Pink Rubber Duck item.

Servers could also compete for a top spot to be the server where users donated the most. The top servers received Pink Rubber Ducks to use however the server owner wanted and money for their server pool.

Once the event ended, all pink plastic bits were removed from the bot completely.
