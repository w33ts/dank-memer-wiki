## Pet Slots {: #PetSlots}
Before you purchase a pet, you need to make sure you have an open pet slot. Every user has 5 pet slots for free. Previously, there was also 1 slot that could only be filled when your pets have a baby, but this secret slot is gone. 

Now, each pet needs a slot, and there are no hidden slots. If you previously had a baby pet when secret slots existed, you'll have to make sure the baby pet is in a lot before you can obtain any new pets. You can read more about how pet slots work <a href="https://dankmemer.lol/tutorial/pet-slots" target="_blank">in the pets slots tutorial.</a> 

After you have used the 5 free pet slots, you can unlock more pets by buying new pet slots from the `/advancements upgrades` for money.

You get 5 free pet slots in the beginning and then can purchase up to 45 more if you'd like. If you want your pets to be able to have baby pets, make sure you have an empty slot available for one. You can not have more baby pets if all your pet slots are filled.

## Pet Babies
Legend has it that your pets can make babies. We believe the following circumstances have to be true in order for this to happen, but we can't be certain as this is legend after all. Play around with your pets and see if you can get them to make a baby!
- Have an open pet slot;
- Hug your pets --> Some pets need to be "loved" and some need to be in "Love Mode";
- Pets can't be "hostile" towards each other
- "Pet Breeding" has to be enabled in `/settings`

***The above may also be entirely inaccurate and we accept no form of liability if your pets hate you***

## Caring for Pets {: #PetsCare}
In order for your pets to be happy, you need to keep their love stat up. You can see your pet's love stat in the `/pets view `command. 

To keep a pet's love up, you need to take care of your pet by feeding, playing, and washing it. You can take care of your pets by using the `/pets care` command. When your pet is happy, it can bring you items and coins as rewards.

<center>
  
![pets_care.png](/bot-features/pets/pets_care.png)
  

| Button | What It Does |
|:------:|:----:|
| Feed | Feed your pet to take care of the Hunger stat. You can do this with coins or pet food. If you have pet food in your inventory, it'll automatically take a pet food to feed your pet, which gives way more exp than if you'd feed it with coins |
| Wash | Wash your pet to take care of the Hygiene stat |
| Play | Play with your pet to take care of the Fun stat. This is **always** a minigame |
| Hug | Hug your pet, this doesn't really do anything |
| Fetch | Play fetch with your pet. This gives your pet XP but also lets your pet find you items, based on the hunting skill level they have |
| Walk | Walk with your pet. This gives your pet XP, if you have a pet saddle in your inventory, you'll get even more XP per walk |
  
 </center>

Not taking care of your pet will result in the pet losing 1 level per day until they reach level 0. For now, the pet will not run away until mentioned otherwise. 


## Training Pets {: #PetsTraining}
You can train your pets in a few different ways via the `/pets view` command.

<center>

![pets_view.png](/bot-features/pets/pets_view.png)

</center>

Below are the possible buttons on the `/pets view` command with a brief explanation of what they do.
| Button | What It Does |
|:------:|:----:|
| Set current | Set one of your pets (if you have more than 1) as your current pet, this pet is also the pet that has a chance on attacking others if you are getting robbed |
| Rename | Rename the pet you got selected | 
| Train | Use your skill points ( 4 + 1 point per pet level you got for that pet) to train your pet, max 30 skill points can be used | 
| Prestige | Pet prestige your pet, this is unlimited. The first 3 pet prestiges are at pet level 35, after that the requirement increases by 5 pet levels per prestige |
| Disown | Disown the current selected pet.

**Note** - If your pets lose a level and then you earn the level back, you may get a notice that they have training points to apply, but you won't have any because you already used them when they were at that level previously.

### Pet skills
As your pets level up, they'll earn skill points. You can train your pet with up to 30 skill points. Each skill has a different benefit.

| Skill | What It Does |
|:------:|:----:|
| Attack | Makes your pet deal more base damage during pet fights |
| Defense | Makes your pet take less base damage during pet fights | 
| Sustainability | Makes your pet's stats last longer, so you have more time before you have to interact with your pet again |
| Hunting | The hunting skill is what allows your pet to bring you items and coins. You need at least one point for a pet to bring you rewards, and the higher the hunting level, the better the items your pet can fetch/find for you |
