## Care
You can take care of your pets by using the `/pets care` command.

![pets_care.png](/bot-features/pets/pets_care.png)

| Button | What It Does |
|:------:|:----:|
| Feed | Feed your pet to take care of the Hunger stat. You can do this with coins or pet food. If you have pet food in your inventory, it'll automatically take a pet food to feed your pet, which gives way more exp than if you'd feed it with coins |
| Wash | Wash your pet to take care of the Hygiene stat |
| Play | Play with your pet to take care of the Fun stat. This is **always** a minigame |
| Hug | Hug your pet, this doesn't really do anything |
| Fetch | Play fetch with your pet. This gives your pet XP but also lets your pet find you items, based on the hunting skill level they have |
| Walk | Walk with your pet. This gives your pet XP, if you have a pet saddle in your inventory, you'll get even more XP per walk |

Not taking care of your pet will result in the pet losing 1 level per day until they reach level 0. For now, the pet will not run away until mentioned otherwise.

## Getting new pet slots

Every use has 5 pet slots for free, plus 1 slot that can only be filled when your pets have a baby. You can read more about how pet slots work <a href="https://dankmemer.lol/tutorial/pet-slots" target="_blank">in the pets slots tutorial.</a> 

After you have used the 5 free pet slots, you can unlock more pets by buying new pet slots from the `/advancements upgrades` for money.

You get 5 free pet slots in the beginning and then can purchase up to 19 more if you'd like. After having all the pet slots filled, it is still possible for some of your pets to have a baby, which can give you 1 more extra pet, up to a total of 25 pets.

You can not have more baby pets if all your pet slots are filled.

## Pet baby
Legend has it that your pets can make babies. We believe the following circumstances have to be true in order for this to happen, but we can't be certain as this is legend after all. Play around with your pets and see if you can get them to make a baby!
- Have an open pet slot;
- Hug your pets --> Some pets need to be "loved" and some need to be in "Love Mode";
- Pets can't be "hostile" towards each other

***The above may also be entirely inaccurate and we accept no form of liability if your pets hate you***

## Training
You can train your pets via the `/pets view` command.

<center>

![pets_view.png](/bot-features/pets/pets_view.png)

</center>

Here you can click multiple buttons, the function can be found in the table below:
| Button | What It Does |
|:------:|:----:|
| Set current | Set one of your pets (if you have more than 1) as your current pet, this pet is also the pet that has a chance on attacking others if you are getting robbed |
| Rename | Rename the pet you got selected | 
| Train | Use your skill points ( 4 + 1 point per pet level you got for that pet) to train your pet, max 30 skill points can be used | 
| Prestige | Pet prestige your pet, this is unlimited. The first 3 pet prestiges are at pet level 35, after that the requirement increases by 5 pet levels per prestige |
| Disown | Disown the current selected pet.

### Pet skills
You can train your pet with up to 30 skill points.

There are 4 skills:
| Skill | What It Does |
|:------:|:----:|
| Attack | Deal more base damage during pet fights |
| Defence | Take less base damage during pet fights | 
| Sustainability | Take longer time before you have to interact with your pet again |
| Hunting | The higher hunting level, the better the items your pet can fetch/find for you |
