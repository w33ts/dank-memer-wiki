# Lotteries
Dank Memer has two lotteries you can enter and try to win. The <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Lotteries#BlackHole" target="_blank">Black Hole lottery</a> is announced once a day and gives you a chance to win items. The <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Lotteries#DankLottery" target="_blank">Dank Memer Lottery</a> is every hour and gives you a chance to win varying amounts of coins.

## Black Hole Lottery {: #BlackHole}

The Black Hole lottery is a **daily** lottery held by the bot. If a user has one or more black holes in their inventory when they are running commands, there is a chance it could take an item received from a command. For example, if you fish and get a common fish as a reward, the black hole could suck it up. Once an item has been taken, you are entered into the Black Hole lottery.

Every day, 5 winners are posted at midnight <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc" target="_blank">UTC</a>  in the <a href="https://discord.gg/memers" target="_blank">Dank Memer Community</a> server's Dank Lottery channel. The winners split 95% of all the loot that was sucked into black holes that day. Each winner will get a DM from the bot with a list of the rewards, and all winners get the same reward.

## Dank Lottery {: #DankLottery}

Contrary to the Black Hole lottery, the Dank lottery is an **hourly** lottery held by the bot. Users can enter the lottery as many times as they want per hour using the `/lottery buy` command and can buy as many tickets as they want. Each ticket costs 10,000 coins, and the winner receives all of the entry fees minus a lottery tax that is taken from the winnings before the winner is paid.

Each hour the winner is announced in the Dank Lottery channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/memers" target="_blank">Dank Memer Community</a> Server. Winners are also DM'd by the bot, so they know they won. Winning the lottery makes it so that nobody can steal from you for the next 3 hours, so you have time to avoid being <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Rob-and-Heist" target="_blank">robbed</a>.

If you want to enter the lottery every hour, you can also buy the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Advancements/Upgrades#AutoLottery" target="_blank">/lottery auto</a> command from <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Advancements/Upgrades" target="_blank">/advancements upgrades</a>. This allows you to set a specific amount you want to enter each hour, and then the bot will take the money for you each hour until you disable the command or run out of money.

Remember, the Dank lottery has a 35% tax on the total amount of coins being paid out, so if you spend a lot of money, you might lose some due to tax too.
