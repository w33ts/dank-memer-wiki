# Fishing Skills and Skill Challenges
<a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing" target="_blank">Fishing</a> skills are skills you can upgrade in `/fish skills` to help you while fishing. To upgrade a fishing skill, you need a fish skill point. You can earn skill points by completing the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#SkillChallenges" target="_blank">Skill Challenges</a> found in the `/fish guide` command. There are a variety of challenges, and some skills can help you complete the challenges faster.

If you decide you do not like the skills you've put your skill points on, you can reset your skills once every 3 days for free. When you reset your skill points, it will remove any skill points you've applied and put them back to your total so you can apply them again however you want. If you are impatient and do not want to wait 3 days, you can bypass the wait time by using gems.

Read details below about what each skill does below and any requirements needed to unlock the skill, or check out the  section for suggestions about what skills might help you with specific challenges.

## Fish Skills {: #FishSkills}

There are four categories for fishing skills available in `/fish skills`:
- <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#Economy" target="_blank">Economy Skills</a>
- <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#Nature" target="_blank">Nature Skills</a>
- <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#Social" target="_blank">Social Skills</a>
- <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#Science" target="_blank">Science Skills</a>

Each category focuses on helping you improve one aspect of fishing, whether it is meant to help you do better with NPCs or to help you sell your fish for more. It is extremely useful to upgrade your fishing skills, and you'll want to complete as many skill challenges as you can.

In order to unlock some of the skills, you might be required to have a certain badge. For example, some skills require you to have the Seasoned Angler Badge to apply a skill point. In order to earn the fishing badge, you must <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Guide" target="_blank">complete the fishing guide book.</a>
