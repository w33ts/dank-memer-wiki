# Fishing Skills and Skill Challenges
<a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing" target="_blank">Fishing</a> skills are skills you can upgrade in `/fish skills` to help you while fishing. There are tons of skills to browse, and each one has multiple levels. If you want to view a specific skill, you can enter the name of the skill in the optional "search" section of the command to go straight to a skill page.

To upgrade a fishing skill, you need a fish skill point. You can earn skill points by completing the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#SkillChallenges" target="_blank">Skill Challenges</a> found in the `/fish guide` command. There are a variety of challenges, and some skills can help you complete the challenges faster.

If you decide you do not like the skills you've put your skill points on, you can reset your skills once every 3 days for free. When you reset your skill points, it will remove any skill points you've applied and put them back to your total so you can apply them again however you want. If you are impatient and do not want to wait 3 days, you can bypass the wait time by using gems.

Read details below about what each skill does below and any requirements needed to unlock the skill or explore the possible Skill Challenges.

## Fish Skills {: #FishSkills}

There are four categories  in `/fish skills` available:
- <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#Economy" target="_blank">Economy Skills</a>
- <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#Nature" target="_blank">Nature Skills</a>

- <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Skills#Science" target="_blank">Science Skills</a>

Each category focuses on helping you improve one aspect of fishing, whether it is meant to help you do better with NPCs or to help you sell your fish for more. It is extremely useful to upgrade your fishing skills, and you'll want to complete as many skill challenges as you can.

In order to unlock some of the skills, you might be required to have a certain badge. For example, some skills require you to have the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Badges#Angler" target="_blank">Seasoned Angler Badge</a> to apply a skill point. In order to earn the fishing badge, you must <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Grind-Commands/Fishing/Guide" target="_blank">complete the fishing guide book.</a>

For skills that require you to have the <a href="/Bot-features/Currency-Commands/Badges#Angler" target="_blank">Platinum Seasoned Angler Badge</a>, keep in mind that the platinum version is just a skin and does not count as a badge unless you have the gold badge as well.
